## Introduction

<Impulse /> is a loose, simplified [TTRPG framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game)
inspired by [improv comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre) and [the principle of "yes
and"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...) , where games play out like a movie that everyone is
co-writing in real time.

Being designed for one-shot campaings, <Impulse /> games don't come with intricate, fleshed-out worlds.
They start with a setting, some characters, and an end goal in mind.
It's up to everyone playing where it goes from there.

## Roles

The **Game Director** is responsible for introducing a setting, and keeping the story on track.
They narrate the action and play the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in the world.

**Players** are responsible for working with each other to create the story
and drive the narrative by interacting with each other and the world.

## Characters

Each Player creates and controls one Character at a time. These are simple, comprising 6 attributes:

<PlayerCharacterAttributes />

## Skills

Skills are dependent on the setting, and are defined by the Game Director.
When the Player is asked to make a skill check, the Game Director picks which
one or two skills are most appropriate, and decides on a Difficulty Rating for the check.
The Player rolls one of their corresponding dice, and needs to roll _at least_ the Difficulty Rating to pass.

### Difficulty Ratings (DR)

DRs are a rough indication of how challenging an action is. The Game Director decides these based on the context of what's happening.

For example, breaking open a rickety wooden door might be a low DR like 2, whereas lockpicking a secure vault door might be a high DR such as 18.

### Critical successes

If the Player rolls the maximum possible value, they roll their dice again and add their results together.
This is done as many times as the Player rolls the maximum value.

### Failures

If a Player fails a check by not rolling at least the Difficulty Rating, the Game Director decides what happens as a result.
Keeping with the principal of "yes, and", failures should alter the narrative rather than stop it.

Sometimes, there won't be any repercussions, such as if a character narrowly fails the check,
or if it's for something mundane, like shooting a tin off of a fence in a safe setting.

However, if the Player rolls very low and/or is attempting something outlandish, then there _may_ be stronger repercussions.
For example, somebody rolling a 1 on an outlandish attempt to show off by performing a backflip on a
galloping horse while crossing a high bridge is likely to meet their end quite quickly.

### Edits

Players _may_ start a game with one or more Edits.
If used, they are awarded before a game by the Game Director,
such as for Players creating engaging characters, or turning up dressed as their character.

Edits can be exchanged at any time by a Player to re-roll a dice they have just rolled, before the story continues.
The Player takes the higher of the two outcomes, such that no Player can re-roll and end up with a lower result.

### Collaboration

Where sensible, the Game Director may allow Players to work together to perform an action.
In this case, the Players will roll their respective dice, and add the results together to beat the DR.
The Game Director may raise the DR to maintain a challenge, but it should still be easier than
the original DR would have been to reward Players working together.

## Inventories

Characters don't have a pre-defined inventory.
Instead, Players should understand the setting and have an idea of what their characters may carry.
Players can then produce sensible items when needed, rather than being defined up-front.
This aims to keep the action flowing, rather than blocking it while Players think of a backup plan.

## Health

Characters (be they Players or NPCs) don't have a health bar; instead, their health state
is conveyed narratively, such as through cuts, wounds, or broken bones.

Characters become progressively damaged during action, based on what happens to them.
The Game Director decides how damaged a character is based on dice rolls and character actions.

Characters may heal and become less damaged by performing actions during or after combat.
Again, the new health state is decided by the Game Director.

### Damage types

There is no concept of damage types like lethal or non-lethal. Instead, the Game Director chooses
what happens to a character once they become too damaged. For example, a fisticuff brawl in a bar would likely
end with a character falling unconcious, whereas a full-blown shootout would likely end with a character dying.

### Life and death

To maintain a sense of risk, Players have no plot armour and can readily die.
If this happens, the Game Director tries to bring the Player back with a new character as soon as makes sense in the story.

## Turns

Turns are ordered during action sequences to ensure PCs and NPCs get fair opportunities to take actions against each other.

The order is decided by the Game Director based on the context. For example, characters setting a surprise ambush would act before their targets.
All else being equal, Players will decide their order based on rolling the most relevant skill at the time.
The Game Director then slots NPC actions in around the Players to keep action flowing.

Characters should stick to one movement and one action per turn, taken in either order.
